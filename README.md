# rabbit_code
A little coding game made for the department promotion week at my university.

This project uses the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) by the [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

# How to play:
* On the right side there are 4 type of command block you can use (forward, loop-4, turn left, turn right), with play button and return button underneath.
* Drag the command block onto the command list, hit play button to run your command, hit return button to return to edit mode.
* Right click or drag out command block in the list to remove them.
* Loop command will loop 4 times and you can nest them, play button wont work if loop start and loop end aren't matched.
