# rabbit_code
A little coding game made for the department promotion week at my university.
This project uses the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) by the [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

How to play:
On the right side there are 4 command type you can use (from top: forward, loop-4, turn left, turn right), with play button and return button under them.
Drag the command block onto the command list and hit play button to run your command, hit return button to edit your command.
Right click or drag out command block in the list to remove them.
Loop command will loop 4 times and you can nest them, play button wont work if loop start and loop end aren't matched.
